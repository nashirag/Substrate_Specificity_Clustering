# Substrate_Specificity_Clustering
A method of clustering peptide array data to compare substrate specificity between multiple enzymes


# Usage Notes
Ensure substrate specificity arrays are represented as .csv files with amino acids in first row and columns
These may be kept in a separate folder named 'matrices'

Dendrogram output will be in the 'matrices' folder
